# Tiki Scraping

## Introduction

**[Tiki.VN](https://tiki.vn/)** was founded by Son Ngoc Thai Tran in March 2010, at a time when the Vietnamese market was still new to E-Commerce. After 9 years of growing, it is currently one of the biggest online shopping platform in Vietnam.

**Tiki Scraping project** is the project that we finished after **the 2nd week** of studying **Machine Learning**.

**Project goals:**

**1. Crawling all products from Tiki with user ratings and comments**

**2. Pushing the data to a PostgreSQL database**

**3. Analyzing the data to get more insights of Tiki's business**

## Project Plan

* Install PostgreSQL
* Create Database `tiki` and Create tables for `Users`, `Products`, `Categories`, `Comments` in `db_init.py` (We currently have `Categories` and `Products` tables; `Users` and `Comments` tables belong to further work).
* Move solution of Week 1 project to a Python script `tiki_scraping.py` 
* Improve week 1 solution to get more info of the products
* Write functions to save `product` into the database 
* Analyze the data on Jupyter Notebook
* Implement the complete solution
* Push the solution to a new Github repo

## I. Install PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system. Using a database instead of regular spreadsheet will allow us to store a larger amount of data as well as offer a much higher capacity to later process our data. 

### Installation on Window
* [This link](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/) will give you the detailed description of the installation for Window.

### Installation on Linux 
* Step1: You can download the Post greSql source code from [this link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) choose the mirror site that is located in your country & Install the Postgre SQL using commands
```
# tar xvfz postgresql-8.3.7.tar.gz 
cd postgresql-8.3.7
./configure
```


* Step 2: After the installation, make sure `bin`, `doc`, `include`, `lib`, `man` and share directories are created under the default `/usr/local/pgsql` directory 
```
ls -l /usr/local/pgsql/
```

*  Step 3: Create postgreSQL user account and data directory
* Step 4: Intialize the postgreSQL data directory & Validate it
* Step 8: Start postgreSQL database
* Step 9: Create postgreSQL DB and test the installation
* For more detailed steps please refer [this link](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/04/linux-postgresql-install-and-configure-from-source/).

#### Example: On Ubuntu 18.04
* Step 1: Ubuntu's default repositories contain Postgres packages, so you can install these using the `apt` packaging system. Since this is your first time using `apt` in this session, refresh your local package index.
 
* Step 2: Install the Postgres package along with a -contrib package that adds some additional utilities and functionality using below commands:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### Installation of PostgreSQL on Mac OSX
* Step 1: Getting Homebrew : Install PostgreSQL on the command line we will be using a package manager called [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Step 2: Install the Postgre
  Run the following command to install PostgreSQL using Homebrew:
```
brew install postgresql
```
* Step 3: Letâ€™s go ahead and start Postgres running, and make sure Postgres starts every time your computer starts up. Execute the following command:
```
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start && brew services start postgresql
```

* Step 4: Finally, you can make sure Postgres is installed, running and check what version it is by giving following command:
```
postgres -V
```
* For more detailed information you can refer [this link](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb)

## II. Create Database & Create Table
### 1. Create a connection to PostgreSQL database server through command prompt 
The following command connects to a database under a specific user. After pressing Enter PostgreSQL will ask for the password of the user.
```
psql -d *databasename* -U *usersname*
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZGfNUUH.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

If you want to enable external access to a database that resides on another host, you add the `-h` option as follows:
```
psql -h <host> -p <port> -U <username> -W <password> <database>
```
`-h`: allows you to change IP address of the targeted computer.
`<host>`: Server's IP address on which postgres is to listen for TCP/IP connections from client applications.
`<port>`: Specifies the TCP/IP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which postgres is to listen for connections from client applications (normally 5432).

|Commands | Description | 
| -------- | -------- | 
|\\?          |Know all available psql commands| 
| h ALTER TABLE   |Get help on specific PostgreSQL statement|
|\c dbname username  |Switch the connection to a new database|
|\l   | List all databases|
|\dt   | List all tables
|\d tablename|Describe a table such as a column, type, modifiers of columns, etc.|
|\du|List all users and their assign roles|
|\timing|Turn on or off query execution time|
|\e|Edit command in your own (favorite) editor|
|\a|Command switches from aligned to non-aligned column output|
|\H|Command formats the output to HTML format|
|\q|Quit psql|

### 2. Create a connection to Postgres from Python
* Connect to a database using psycopg2
```python
import psycopg2
def db_get_connection():
    # Input your username, password, host's number, port and
    # and the created database
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user = "yourusername",
                                  password = 'yourpassword',
                                  host = "127.0.0.1",
                                  port = "5432",
                                  database = "tiki")
    return connection
    #test the connection
get_connection() 
```
***In Python, there is an open source library called [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) that implements the Postgres protocol to connect to our Postgres server. You can think of psycopg2 being similar to connecting to a SQLite database using the [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/sqlite3.html) library.***

### 3. Create table in PostgreSQL Database
* Create an empty table in our local PostgreSQL
* Cursor allows Python code to execute PostgreSQL command during our session (connection).
* Cursor encapsulates the query, and then read the query result a few rows at a time.
* *Advantage:* 
     * Avoid memory overrun when the result contains a large number of rows.
     *  Return a reference to a cursor that a function has created, allowing the caller to read the rows.
```python 
def create_tables():
    """ Create tables categories, products
    """
    try:
        connection = db_get_connection()
        if not connection:
            print('ERROR: Connection db fail')
            return
        cur = connection.cursor()

        query = """
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS categories (
				category_id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
				name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
				url VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
                parent INTEGER,
                weight FLOAT,
                count INTEGER,
				created_on TIMESTAMP
			);
		"""
        cur.execute(query)

        query = """
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
				product_id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
				category_id_fkey INTEGER REFERENCES categories(category_id),
                data_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
                seller_id VARCHAR(100),
				title TEXT NOT NULL,
				price INTEGER,
                brand VARCHAR(50),
				avg_rating FLOAT,
                total_ratings INTEGER,
				url TEXT,
				image_url TEXT,
				created_on TIMESTAMP,
                tiki_now BOOLEAN
			);
		"""
        cur.execute(query)

### Further work
### We currently have `Categories` and `Products` tables; `Users` and `Comments` tables belong to further work.
```python 
query = """
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
				user_id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
				username VARCHAR(50),
				created_on TIMESTAMP
			);
		"""
        cur.execute(query)

        query = """
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (
				user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
				product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
				PRIMARY KEY (user_id, product_id),
				content TEXT,
				rating FLOAT,
				CONSTRAINT comments_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
				CONSTRAINT comments_product_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
			);
		   """
        cur.execute(query)

        connection.commit()

    except Exception as error:
        print('ERROR: Create table fail -', error)
        connection.rollback()

    finally:
        cur.close()
        connection.close()

```
### 4. Insert data to PostgresSQL Database
```python
def insert_row(data, table_name, default=True):
    """Insert data into table_name
    """
    # print("INFO: Insert data into {}".format(table_name))

    try:
        connection = db_get_connection()
        if not connection:
            print('ERROR: Connection db fail')
            return
        cur = connection.cursor()

        cols = 'DEFAULT,' if default else ''
        for i in range(len(data)-1):
            cols = cols + '%s,'
        cols = cols + '%s'

        query = 'INSERT INTO ' + table_name + ' VALUES (' + cols + ');'
        cur.execute(query, data)

        connection.commit()

    except Exception as error:
        print('ERROR: Insert into DB fail -', error)
        connection.rollback()

    finally:
        cur.close()
        connection.close()
```
```python 
def execute_query(query):
    """Execute an SELECT query
    """
    print("INFO: Execute {}".format(query))

    try:
        connection = db_get_connection()
        if not connection:
            print('ERROR: Connection db fail')
            return
        cur = connection.cursor()

        cur.execute(query)

        connection.commit()

    except Exception as error:
        print('ERROR: Insert into DB fail -', error)
        connection.rollback()
        return []

    finally:
        return cur.fetchall()
        cur.close()
        connection.close()
```
## III. Data analysis on Jupyter notebook
We analyzed the data by pushing them into **Panda dataframe** and using these packages
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
**We answered these questions:**

* How many products in Tiki, belongs to how many categories?
* How many duplicated products?
* How many products are there in each category?
* How many sellers are there on Tiki?
* How many brands in Tiki? Name top 10 brands with the most products?
* How many products have tikiNow service?
* What is the rating average of all products?
* Which category has the highest rating?
* Which category has the biggest number of comments?
* Which product has the biggest number of comments?
* What is the hottest category or product by review?
* What is the worst category or product by review?
* What are the cheapest and the most expensive products?
* What are the mean prices of each category?
* How customers comment on those products?
* What kinds of books does Tiki offer?
* The relationship between books price and customer's satisfactory?
